						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An investment of £25 is all it takes for [business name] to be listed on BigCityGuide in front of your potential customers looking for [business type] in your area.<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For just the price of a cinema or theatre ticket you can have your business listed on our city guide book mobile app for 12 months, that’s just a fraction of the cost you’d normally spend to put up a print, tv, or radio ad, and with much better results<br><br> 
						
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	You are in __county, correct?  And that’s where you get most of your customers, right?<br><br>
						
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BigCityGuide is a FREE downloadable mobile app for mobile internet users.   For just the price of a cinema or theatre ticket you can have your business listed on the mobile app version of the phone book for 12 months . Potential customers looking for a [business type] like you will see YOUR company information sooner so YOU’LL get the calls.  (Keep in mind that half the people who use the mobile city guide book DON’T have any particular business in mind—they just know what they need.  I’m sure you’d want some of THEM to call you too.)

					<b>QNI - I’VE ALREADY BEEN CALLED ABOUT THIS:</b>
			</div>
			<div class = "icontent" align = "left" style = "display:none;">
				I apologize for that.  Sometimes when businesses have more than 1 phone line, they get more than 1 call. But before I let you go, can I just ask if the person who called you was calling about the BigCityGuide mobile app? And did they review our special offer with you? The reason I ask is that I’d hate to see you miss out.   It really is a great new offer …

			</div>
			<div class = "icontent" align = "left" style = "display:none;">
				You don't need a computer or Smartphone to be on BigCityGuide, lots of our customers don't either.  But many people who could become YOUR customers are using BigCityGuide on their smartphone to find the people they do business with.  For just about the price of a cinema or theatre ticket, you can be listed on BigCityGuide so people who are looking for a business like yours can find you.  And you'd also want to be sure that the people who are recommended to you can locate you easily, right?

						<b>WORD OF MOUTH / REFERRAL</b>
				</div>
				<div class = "icontent" align = "left" style = "display:none;">
					Even when a customer is referred to you by word of mouth they usually are only given your NAME.    Often they get more than one referral, too.  They STILL end up going to the city guide book to get your phone number or address so they can contact you.  You want to make sure they find YOUR listing instead of just a competitor’s right?<br>
					Plus, about 50% of the people who does a business search don't have any specific business name or referral in mind--they just know what they need.  (newcomers, emergency buyers, dissatisfied, infrequent, comparison shoppers, travelers-business or vacation).  You have a right to a share of THAT business too, even if they weren't referred, right?

					<b>I USE OTHER FORMS OF ADVERTISING</b>
				</div>
				<div class = "icontent" align = "left" style = "display:none;">
					It's great that you see the benefits of advertising.  What kind of advertising do you do?<br><br>
					Newspaper/Magazine/Flyer/Direct Mail/Commercials<br>
					That's a good way to get your name out there and let people know what you offer.  But that's considered CREATIVE  ADVERTISING.  The prospective buyer may not need your product or service at the time they see your advertising.  Later on, when they DO have the need, the Creative Advertising is no longer in front of them.  So they turn to the guide books to direct them to a business that has what they're looking for.   So that's why you need to be sure they can find you then.  Otherwise the investment you made in your Creative Advertising could be wasted.  BigCityGuide is an insurance policy that protects the dollars you spend on your other advertising.  Plus with BigCityGuide, you can make unlimited updates on your listing with no additional cost

					<b>WE HAVE MORE BUSINESS THAN WE CAN HANDLE</b>
				</div>
				<div class = "icontent" align = "left" style = "display:none;">
					You’re lucky because not every business that I talk to can say that.  But most of the businesses that I’ve worked with like yours tell me that there are certain aspects of your business that are more profitable than others.  So if I could get you more calls, you’d be able to pick and choose the work that you make the most money on.  I’m not talking about bringing in MORE customers, because as you said, you really can’t handle any more than you have.  I’m talking about bringing in different customers.  You’d still be working the same amount of hours, but you’d make more money in the end. And even successful businesses like yours do lose customers—people die or move away or maybe you drop them because they don’t pay on time.  You do have to replace the ones that you lose to keep your business healthy.

					<b>CAN’T AFFORD</b>
				</div>
				<div class = "icontent" align = "left" style = "display:none;">
					Being listed on BigCityGuide is a productive expense because it brings the buyer to you at that special moment—when he’s made the decision to buy and wants to know just who has what he’s looking for.  That’s a claim that no other form of advertising can make.  It not only pays for itself quickly, it generates profits that help you pay for some of your other fixed costs like electricity or rent.  BigCityGuide is something you can’t afford to be without.

					<b>CUSTOMER WORTH</b>
				</div>
				<div class = "icontent" align = "left" style = "display:none;">
					May I ask, when you get a new customer, how much would they spend with you?.........Well, I’m not sure what your profit margin is, but how many new customers would it take to cover an investment of about two to three pounds per month? For just the price of a cinema or theatre ticket you can have your business listed on the mobile app version of the phone book for 12 months.

				<div class = "icontent" align = "left" style = "display:none;">
					I’m sorry to hear that, but then I’m really glad I called.  It sounds like you need more customers, and BigCityGuide can bring them to you.  For just the price of a cinema or theatre ticket you can have your business listed on the mobile app version of the phone book  and you’ll have access to a whole new group of potential customers for 12 months.

					Mr/Mrs._______ I understand your concern.  Since the national do not call list

					All right, then we’ll add your number to our Do Not Call list.
					May I ask, are there any additional numbers for this business that should be added?  {capture any additional numbers}
