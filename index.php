				3.	A unique login & password is then created for the business. This together with the business name is copied into a final email which is sent to the business.  This final email contains 2 links.  The first to complete their business details – business description, opening hours & twitter feed,  the second is a link to paypal so they can complete their payment.<br><br>
				4.	Some businesses will be national or regional in nature and it may be better to deal with them on that basis.<br><br>
