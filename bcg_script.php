				<i>(If no, ask them if they have a computer, then walk them through the features on our website. If no computer and no phone, then just go through the features with them verbally).</i><br><br>
				<b>Features (give benefit statements)</b><br>

				To help you boost your business, we have created a profile of your [business type] on bigcityguide for you to have a first hand feel of what it is like to be in our mobile app, and to let all those tourists know who and where [business name] is.<br><br>

				Updating your business to our database is easy. I can gather information like opening times, a short description of your business, contact information, 2 keywords that will help users locate you...<br><br>
					
				Once updated, your business profile is accessible to millions of iPhone or Android based Smartphone users who may potentially be your customers.<br>
				Listing with BigCityGuide is just a fraction of the cost it would take to put up a newspaper or media ad, with much better results. It’s only £25 annually or about 2 pounds and few pence a month. There are no long term contracts with BigCityGuide
